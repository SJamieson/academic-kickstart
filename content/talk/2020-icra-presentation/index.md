# Abstract. What's your talk about?
abstract = "We present a novel POMDP problem formulation for  a  robot  that  must  autonomously  decide  where  to  go  tocollect  new  and  scientifically  relevant  images  given  a  limited ability  to  communicate  with  its  human  operator.  From  this formulation we derive constraints and design principles for the observation model, reward model, and communication strategy of such a robot, exploring techniques to deal with the very high-dimensional observation space and scarcity of relevant training data.  We  introduce  a  novel  active  reward  learning  strategy based  on  making  queries  to  help  the  robot  minimize  path “regret”  online,  and  evaluate  it  for  suitability  in  autonomous visual exploration through simulations. We demonstrate that, in some  bandwidth-limited  environments,  this  novel  regret-based criterion enables the robotic explorer to collect up to 17% more reward  per  mission  than  the  next-best criterion."
