abstract = """
The  popularity  of  deep  learning  among  roboticists  is  not evidence  that  it  is  a  fruitful  path  to  a  greater  scientific understanding into open problems in robotics. Nonetheless, I will argue that the pervasiveness of deep learning in robotics research  is  not  an  impediment  to  scientific  insights  into robotics  problems,  but  rather  leads  to  a  probabilistic  and data-driven perspective that will be essential for solving the next generation of robotics challenges.
