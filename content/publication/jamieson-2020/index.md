abstract: "We present a novel POMDP problem formulation for a robot that must autonomously decide where to go to collect new and scientifically relevant images, given a limited ability to communicate with its human operator. From this formulation we derive constraints and design principles for the observation model, reward model, and communication strategy of such a robot, exploring techniques to deal with the very high-dimensional observation space and scarcity of relevant training data. We introduce a novel active reward learning strategy based on making queries to help the robot minimize path ``regret'' online and evaluate it for suitability in autonomous visual exploration through simulations. We demonstrate that, in some bandwidth limited environments, this novel regret-based criterion enables the robotic explorer to collect up to 17% more reward per mission than the next-best criterion."
