abstract: Contemporary scientific exploration most often takes place in highly remote
  and dangerous environments, such as in the deep sea and on other planets. These
  environments are very hostile to humans, which makes robotic exploration the first
  and often the only option. However, they also impose restrictive limits on how much
  communication is possible, creating challenges in implementing remote command and
  control.
